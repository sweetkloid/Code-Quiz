# Code-Quiz
Challenge 4 

##  Description
For this project we needed to create a quize that realates to coding. In this quiz we need to hide and show elements so we can switch between the homepage and the questions. During that time whenever a question is clicked wrong seconds are to be taken off the timer. When correct nothing happens to the timer. At the end of the quiz a submit button will show the total score (to equal the time remaining). Once the initials are entered the score and initials are loaded into localstorage. We are then taken to a highscore page. All of these pages are linked together so we can access them at any time from their respective home pages.
